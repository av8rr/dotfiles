#+TITLE: Install Drive Mappings

During the install process, configure the OS on drive 1 and reference /home and /rdr on drive 2. The following table shows drive setup for drive 1 (SDA) and drive 2 (SDB). It is important that drive 1 contain the OS and supporting mappings while drive 2 only contains the /rdr and /home directoryies.

*NOTE* The OS can be reinstalled as many times as necessary along with the programs. Since /home contains all configurations, the newly installed programs will be configured quickly and use the existing configuration settings.

* Lenovo ThinkPad w520

This laptop has two drives.First internal drive is 500 GB and a second, add-on tray-based is 1 TB for a total of 1.5 TB. Note that /rdr and /home are on the tray-based drive.

* Lenovo ThinkPad Extreme Gen 4

This new laptop is a single drive machine. The architecture does not support two drives (at least I have not installed a second drive in the wireless radio space - something I would look into!

Note the values in LSBLK do not match the table above. I assume LSBLK reports amount of free space. However, I list this in case we need to compare.
